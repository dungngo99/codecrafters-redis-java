<h1>Redis Server in Java</h1>

<p>
This project is a Redis server implementation in <strong>Java</strong>, built from scratch as part of the 
<a href="https://codecrafters.io/">Codecrafters Redis Challenge</a>.  
It follows the <strong>client–server architecture</strong> and can accept requests from the Redis CLI over TCP sockets. 
Communication between client and server is handled using the <strong>RESP protocol</strong>.
</p>

<h2>RESP Protocol</h2>

<p>
The Redis Serialization Protocol (<strong>RESP</strong>) is the core communication protocol between Redis clients and servers.
</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Key properties of RESP:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Binary-safe: Works with arbitrary byte sequences.</li>
  <li>Length-prefixed: Encodes data with size information for efficient parsing.</li>
  <li>Simple &amp; human-readable: Easy for developers to debug.</li>
  <li>Fast to parse: Optimized for high-performance servers.</li>

<h2>Replication 101</h2>

<p>
Redis replication is the foundation for high availability and failover. A <strong>Master node</strong> handles both read and write requests, 
while <strong>Replica nodes</strong> serve read-only requests. When clients send writes to the Master, it propagates the changes to all connected Replicas as a stream of bytes.
</p>

<p>There are two main aspects of replication:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Full sync vs. Partial sync:</strong>  
    - After a disconnection or crash, a Replica may request a <em>partial sync</em> if its local state is still within the Master’s backlog buffer.  
    - If not possible, the Replica requests a <em>full sync</em>, where the Master generates an RDB snapshot and transfers it as a byte stream.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asynchronous vs. Synchronous syncing:</strong>  
    - In <em>asynchronous</em> replication, the Master sends updates in the background without waiting for Replica acknowledgments.  
    - In <em>synchronous</em> replication, the Master waits for acknowledgments from <em>N</em> Replicas before confirming a write.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Replication Mechanism</h2>

<p>
Redis replication relies on a well-defined ID and offset system to track dataset versions and synchronize efficiently.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Replication ID and Offset:</strong>  
    Each Master maintains a unique <code>replication ID</code> (40-character string) and an <code>offset</code>.  
    Every client write increases the Master’s offset, which is used to determine how Replicas catch up.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PSYNC Command:</strong>  
    Replicas use <code>PSYNC</code> to request synchronization. If their offset falls within the Master’s backlog buffer, the Master sends only the missing byte stream. Otherwise, a full sync is performed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Replication Steps (Master → Replica):</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>The Master spawns a background process to create an RDB snapshot, while buffering client commands in parallel.</li>
      <li>The snapshot (RDB file) is transferred to the Replica and loaded into memory.</li>
      <li>The buffered command stream is sent over (using RESP protocol) to bring the Replica fully up to date.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Efficiency:</strong>  
    If multiple Replicas reconnect at once, the Master reuses a single background save to serve them all, reducing overhead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Auto-reconnect:</strong>  
    Replicas can automatically reconnect and resynchronize when the Master–Replica link is interrupted.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Redis Use Cases</h2>

<p>
Redis is widely used in distributed systems due to its simplicity and speed. Some common patterns:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Distributed Locks</strong><br />
      Implemented with atomic commands like <code>INCR</code> and <code>DEL</code>, often wrapped in Lua scripts for transactional guarantees.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Pub/Sub (Lightweight Event Streaming)</strong><br />
      Similar in spirit to Kafka streams.  
      Events are appended to logs and consumed by <strong>consumer groups</strong>, which distribute messages across workers in parallel.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong><br />
      Sliding window algorithms using atomic commands (<code>INCR</code>, <code>EXPIRE</code>) can enforce request limits efficiently.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Caching</strong><br />
      Fast in-memory key–value store for reducing database load.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Real-time Dashboards</strong><br />
      Using sorted sets (<code>ZSET</code>) for leaderboards, ranking systems, or priority queues.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Challenges in Redis</h2>

<p>
Like any distributed system, Redis comes with design tradeoffs and operational challenges:
</p>

<h3>1. Consistent Hashing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Redis keys are mapped to <strong>hash slots</strong>, which are distributed across nodes.</li>
  <li>If a node fails, consistent hashing allows reassigning only a small portion of slots to other healthy nodes instead of recomputing all keys.</li>
  <li>This reduces <strong>rehashing overhead</strong> and helps maintain cluster stability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Hot-Key Problem</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>hot key</strong> is a key that receives disproportionately high traffic.</li>
  <li>If all requests hit the same node, it creates an <strong>unbalanced workload</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Replicate or shard the hot key into multiple keys, allowing load to spread across nodes.</li>
</ul>
